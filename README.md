## Considerations: ‚úèÔ∏è

* I initially started the project with a more serious approach, sticking to a black-and-white theme. However, since the challenge revolved around rocket launches, I decided to add some creativity (I actually enjoy this theme quite a bit).

* I included an extra page as a fun addition: a rocket launch countdown that redirects to the main page after completing the countdown. (The sound autoplay feature sometimes doesn't work, so I included a demo video for reference.)

* I used CSS Grid to make the page responsive, along with just one media query to adjust the size of the "not found" result image.

* The "not found" result image features an alien and a rocket, which I chose as a playful nod to an alien abduction during a rocket launch.

* I‚Äôm submitting this project at the very last minute because I could only start working on it yesterday (Thursday morning).

* Regarding the tech stack, I only used plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As the saying goes, "done by hand." I‚Äôm aware there are more efficient ways to tackle this project using tools like Node.js or React (but I‚Äôm still at the beginner stage with these frameworks).

* I also chose not to use Bootstrap; even the loading animation was created from zero! (Of course, if the project had required Bootstrap, I would have used it.)

* I‚Äôm really happy with the final result and look forward to your feedback! üôÇ (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
